This game was a school java project. I did 100% of the code. Sorry if the map editor is too complicated. Also, this game has sound, so make sure your volume is low just in case.

And yes, I am aware the code is confusing as hell and could be improved. And yes, every single object I made was public, whoops.

I am uploading an eclipse project along with a jar file.
