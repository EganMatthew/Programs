This is a blackjack simulator I made in Java. I didn't give any 'user' any way of interacting with this program. It's only ever been ran within the IDE, and values are changed within the main method to get different results. I made it so the players can count cards, and vary their bet and or strategy based on that.

I didn't fully test the simulator, but some interesting results were that the house always wins in the long run regardless of strategy.
