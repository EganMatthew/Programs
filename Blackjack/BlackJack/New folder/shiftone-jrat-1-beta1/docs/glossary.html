        <h2>Statistics</h2>

        <table class="definition"><tr class="definition"><td class="definition-key">Enters</td><td class="definition-value">
                The total number of times that a method was entered.
            </td></tr><tr class="definition"><td class="definition-key">Exits</td><td class="definition-value">
                The total number of times that a method was exited. This includes
                both normal returns as well as exceptions thrown. Note that this may
                be less than Enters, if a thread enters a method but never gets a chance
                to complete it.
            </td></tr><tr class="definition"><td class="definition-key">Exceptions Thrown</td><td class="definition-value">
                The total number of times that a method threw an exception to
                it's caller.

                This number will always be less than or equal to Exists.
            </td></tr><tr class="definition"><td class="definition-key">Exception Rate</td><td class="definition-value">
                This is the percentage of exits that were the result of an exception.
            </td></tr><tr class="definition"><td class="definition-key">Uncompleted Calls</td><td class="definition-value">
                The total number of times a thread entered a method but never existed.

                This can happen if a method is never existed by the time the application exists,
                or JRat captures the statistics.

                This is simply
                <i>Enters</i>
                minus
                <i>Exits</i>
                .
            </td></tr><tr class="definition"><td class="definition-key">Total ms</td><td class="definition-value">
                The total number of milliseconds spent in a method. This includes time spent
                in dependent methods.

                This only includes method calls that were existed (for obvious reasons).
            </td></tr><tr class="definition"><td class="definition-key">Min ms</td><td class="definition-value">
                This is the fastest recorded time for the execution of a method.

                This does include the time spent in dependent methods.
            </td></tr><tr class="definition"><td class="definition-key">Max ms</td><td class="definition-value">
                This is the slowest recorded time for the execution of a method.

                This does include the time spent in dependent methods.
            </td></tr><tr class="definition"><td class="definition-key">Average ms</td><td class="definition-value">
                The average number of milliseconds spent in a method.
                That is,
                <i>Total ms</i>
                divided by
                <i>Exits</i>
            </td></tr><tr class="definition"><td class="definition-key">Total Method ms</td><td class="definition-value">
                This is one of the
                <b>most interesting</b>
                numbers for getting a high level
                understanding of the performance soar spots in an application. It is the Total ms
                of a method, minus the Total ms of all the instrumented methods that it calls.

                (Note that if there are any
                <i>Uncompleted Calls</i>
                , then this value will not be shown,
                since it's meaning is questionable and it may actually be negative.)
            </td></tr><tr class="definition"><td class="definition-key">Average Method ms</td><td class="definition-value">
                This is the average amount of time spent in a method, excluding time spent in
                instrumented dependent (called) methods.

                This is the
                <i>Total Method ms</i>
                divided by
                <i>Exists</i>
                .
            </td></tr><tr class="definition"><td class="definition-key">Total Callers</td><td class="definition-value">
                This is a somewhat complex value.

                It represents the total observed contexts in which a method is called.

                The higher this number, the more code depends on this method.

                (Trace Tab)
            </td></tr><tr class="definition"><td class="definition-key">Uncalled</td><td class="definition-value">
                This is the total number of methods in a class or package that were instrumented
                but never entered.

                While JRat does not attempt to be a full coverage analysis tool, it does track
                coverage at the method level (most coverage analysis tools track coverage at the
                line level, which is better).

                If a method is never called, and the application was fully tested,
                it may be a candidate for removal.  (Hierarchy Tab)

            </td></tr><tr class="definition"><td class="definition-key">Coverage %</td><td class="definition-value">
                The percentage of instrumented methods that were entered at least once.

                This is not line level coverage. (Hierarchy Tab)
            </td></tr></table>
